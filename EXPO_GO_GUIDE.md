# Using Expo Go for Faster Development

## Quick Start

1. **Install Expo Go** on your Android device from the Play Store

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd music-mobile
   npm start
   ```

3. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go app (or use the connection URL)

4. **Changes will reload automatically** - no need to rebuild!

## Advantages

✅ **Instant updates** - See changes in seconds, not minutes  
✅ **No build wait** - Skip the 5-10 minute build process  
✅ **Faster iteration** - Perfect for UI and logic changes  
✅ **Easy debugging** - Console logs appear in terminal  

## Limitations

⚠️ **Background audio** - May not work perfectly in Expo Go  
⚠️ **Native features** - Some advanced features require a full build  
⚠️ **Performance** - Slightly slower than production builds  

## When to Use Each

### Use Expo Go for:
- UI changes
- Logic debugging
- Quick feature testing
- Development iteration

### Use Full Build for:
- Testing background audio
- Final testing before release
- Performance testing
- App store submission

## Tips

- Keep the terminal open to see logs
- Use `r` in terminal to reload manually
- Use `m` to toggle menu
- Shake device to open developer menu
